# NOIRBETTIK: Bangla Reading Comprehension-Based MCQ Dataset
## Overview
NOIRBETTIK is a novel Bangla dataset designed for reading comprehension-based multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering tasks. Developed to fill the gap in high-quality Bangla NLP resources, the dataset features authentic Bangla passages sourced from books, articles, and biographies, with corresponding MCQs. Each question includes one correct answer and three distractors, reflecting real-world educational contexts.

This dataset is particularly suited for training deep learning models in Bangla Natural Language Processing (NLP), with potential applications in automated educational systems, reading comprehension tools, and language processing models.
